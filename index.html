      <p>Thanks for your interest in our study. We would like you to participate in our study to evaluate the web-page designs. We expect this study is beneficial to improve the web design for organizing social events. We will ask you to gaze a series of web pages, and to answer a few questions on what you feel after reading the web pages. While doing so, we will measure your attention using an eye-tracker, which is currently located under the screen you are looking at.  At the end of the study, we will also ask you to fill out the demographic questions. </p>

<p>The whole study will take about 20 minutes. For your participation, you will be rewarded with a $10 Amazon Gift Card after completing your participation or we can donate $10 to a charity of your choice.</p>

<p>We will inform you that we will video record your eye-movements on webpages. The collected data will be kept confidential and stored separately from any personally identifiable information. We let you know that some participants may feel discomfort associated from sitting still in one position for 20 minutes; some participants may feel uncomfortable to get tracked on their eye-movements. We also let you know that this study may cause epileptic seizures or loss of consciousness if watching certain images or patterns on a monitor. </p>

<p>Your participation is voluntary, and you are free to stop your participation at any moment. Your refusal to participate or withdrawal will not involve any penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled. </p>

<p>This study is being conducted by Ph.D. student Mia Minhyang Suh and Professor Gary Hsieh of the University of Washington. If you have further questions about this study, or if you feel you have been harmed as a result of your participation, please contact the principal investigator, Mia Suh, at uw.edu </p>

<p>If you have questions about your rights as a research subject, you can also call the Human Subjects Division at (206) 543-0099.</p>

<p>If you are 21 years of age or older, you understood the statement above, and freely consent to participate in the study, please click the “Next” button to read the study instructions. </p>
